Unix Commands:
1. cd
   - Example of cd with no arguments:
     ![Image](cd.png)
     Working Directory: /home
     There was no change to the directory because no argument was entered. The directory stayed as /home. 
     The output was not an error.
     
   - Example of cd with path to a directory:
     
     Working Directory: /home
     The output was a new line of the terminal with the directory now being /home/lecture1, which was the argument entered after the cd command.
     The output was not an error. 
     
   - Example of cd with path to a file:
     Working directory: /home/lecture1
     The output repeated the file path name entered as an argument in the cd command, saying that the argument was not a directory. This was because to use the cd command, a path to a directory needs to be used as an error. 
     The output was an error message saying the inputed argument was not a directory because a file path was used as an argument to try and change the working directory with the cd command. 
     
1. ls
2. cat
